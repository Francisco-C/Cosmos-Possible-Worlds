WEBVTT

00:00:22.734 --> 00:00:25.233
We were
hunters and foragers.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.800
The frontier was everywhere.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.000
We were bounded only by the
earth and the ocean and the sky.

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:54.133
The open road still softly
calls like a nearly forgotten

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.266
song of childhood.

00:00:57.233 --> 00:01:00.667
For all our failings,
despite our limitations and

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.767
fallibilities, we humans
are capable of greatness.

00:01:10.567 --> 00:01:14.533
How far will our nomadic
species have wandered by the

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:17.200
end of the next century?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.800
And the next millennium?

00:01:49.033 --> 00:01:52.734
Welcome back to the
shores of the cosmic ocean...

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.066
An immensity of
space and time,

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:58.700
a vastness still
mostly uncharted.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.200
We're bound for the possible
worlds revealed by science.

00:02:03.967 --> 00:02:07.400
We'll take a ride on the
underground worldwide network

00:02:07.533 --> 00:02:09.266
that no one knew was there.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.333
I'm going to tell you a first
contact story that's true.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.200
We'll meet some of the most
courageous people who ever lived.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.367
And we're going to venture
into the future we can still have,

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.233
to the homes of our distant
descendants among the starts.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.100
Science can carry us
across that vastness.

00:02:34.233 --> 00:02:36.900
But without imagination,
we go nowhere.

00:02:39.133 --> 00:02:42.533
Our Ship of the Imagination
is propelled by twin engines

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:44.867
of skepticism and wonder.

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:49.667
It's guided by the simple set
of rules that define science

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.133
and make it so powerful.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.834
Test ideas by
experiment and observation.

00:02:57.967 --> 00:03:00.567
Build on those ideas
that pass the test.

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:03.367
Reject the ones that fail.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.333
Follow the evidence
wherever it leads.

00:03:06.467 --> 00:03:08.600
And question everything.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.800
Take these rules to heart,
and the cosmos is yours.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.000
Come with me...

00:03:44.633 --> 00:03:47.500
Our Ship of the
Imagination can take us

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.567
anywhere in space and time.

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:55.133
The cosmos is right
outside our front window.

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:59.600
If you want to see
the past, look down.

00:04:12.333 --> 00:04:15.400
And if you want
to see the future, look up.

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:32.900
On this voyage, we are
bound for a distant galaxy.

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:38.467
And we'll discover how
we as a species became

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.800
explorers of the cosmos.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.934
There. There she is.

00:04:44.066 --> 00:04:46.200
NASA's Voyager 1.

00:04:46.333 --> 00:04:48.567
Launched in 1977,

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.467
she is the most distant
object built by human hands.

00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:55.367
She's done some hard traveling
since our last encounter,

00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:58.333
logged another
billion and a half miles.

00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:02.266
Voyager's making for
other parts of our Milky Way,

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.700
but we have another, far
more distant destination.

00:05:06.934 --> 00:05:10.166
The cosmic ocean is
made of space and time.

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:14.000
You can't move in space
without also moving in time.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.834
Our voyage will take us
a long way from home,

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:21.233
a little more than a
billion light-years.

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:24.867
We're also traveling a
billion years into the past,

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.333
to an event so violent it
will even shatter time.

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:42.266
Now, we're getting
close to our destination.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.700
This is what we came for.

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.467
These two black holes were
born from the collapse of a

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.400
pair of massive stars.

00:05:54.066 --> 00:05:56.567
And they've been doing a
gravitational tango ever since

00:05:56.967 --> 00:05:58.667
for millions of years.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.200
We're here for the climax.

00:06:01.467 --> 00:06:04.300
When those two collide,
they will set off a space-time

00:06:04.433 --> 00:06:06.800
tsunami that will
stretch and compress space

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.467
in all directions.

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.233
And it will slow
down time itself,

00:06:11.367 --> 00:06:13.934
before speeding it up
and slowing it down again.

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:43.900
Gravitational...

00:06:44.433 --> 00:06:47.300
and it will slow
down time itself...

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:51.967
Set off a
space-time tsunami...

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.333
Stretch and compress space
in all directions a billion

00:06:55.467 --> 00:06:57.266
light-years away.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.776
What does an event that
took place more than a billion

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.967
light-years away
have to do with us?

00:07:11.467 --> 00:07:14.333
Albert Einstein was the first
to understand that matter

00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:17.133
could send ripples
across space-time.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.033
He imagined that catastrophic
explosions of matter should

00:07:20.166 --> 00:07:23.500
create something much bigger
than ripples, great waves,

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.533
gravitational waves.

00:07:26.667 --> 00:07:29.500
You are seeing and
hearing me right now,

00:07:29.633 --> 00:07:32.867
on whatever device you have,
because we figured out a way

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.967
to manipulate the
electromagnetic spectrum.

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.667
If we can learn to surf
those gravitational waves the

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.800
way we know how to ride
the electromagnetic ones,

00:07:41.934 --> 00:07:43.533
who knows?

00:07:43.667 --> 00:07:46.867
It's as impossible to foresee
as our world was to the

00:07:47.066 --> 00:07:49.467
scientists who experimented
with electricity back

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.100
in the 19th century.

00:07:52.233 --> 00:07:55.100
Cosmologists predicted the
existence of black holes.

00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:59.567
Gravitational waves are the
first direct evidence that

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:01.900
black holes are real.

00:08:02.033 --> 00:08:04.467
But they may also provide
a new way of knowing and

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.300
exploring the cosmos.

00:08:06.433 --> 00:08:08.934
We can add it to the
other senses that science has

00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:12.600
devised to penetrate
the great dark ocean,

00:08:12.734 --> 00:08:15.667
all the kinds of
light we use; Gamma ray,

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.066
X-ray, ultraviolet,

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:27.200
infrared, microwave,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:32.900
radio wave and visible light.

00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:37.667
This newest way to search the
cosmos could help us to one

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.233
day know what's happening
inside those black holes,

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:44.533
and the other hidden
places that make up most

00:08:44.667 --> 00:08:46.633
of the universe.

00:08:46.767 --> 00:08:49.734
What if we could detect the
gravitational waves that were

00:08:49.867 --> 00:08:52.166
caused by the first
moment of creation,

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.734
the birth of the cosmos?

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.233
What if we could extend our
vision to see the whole sweep

00:09:01.367 --> 00:09:04.667
of 14 billion years
of cosmic evolution?

00:09:17.633 --> 00:09:20.233
So, how did we get so smart?

00:09:21.533 --> 00:09:24.600
We know something about the
evolution of our species,

00:09:24.734 --> 00:09:27.367
but how did the
human mind evolve?

00:09:28.567 --> 00:09:31.467
Where did that crazy ambition
to climb the ladder to the

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.333
stars come from?

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:38.633
How did we become a way for
the universe to know itself?

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.633
It started over there.

00:09:49.867 --> 00:09:52.633
Is a way for us to grasp the

00:09:52.767 --> 00:09:54.767
vastness of time.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:56.500
We've taken all of time,

00:09:56.633 --> 00:09:59.100
from the birth of the
universe to this very moment,

00:09:59.233 --> 00:10:02.233
and compressed it into
a single calendar year.

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:04.767
On this scale, every
month represents a little

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.967
more than a billion years.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.400
Every day represents
nearly 40 million years.

00:10:12.133 --> 00:10:15.033
Our own story begins
with all the other life on

00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:17.333
our little world.

00:10:17.467 --> 00:10:20.433
Every living thing on
Earth is descended from

00:10:20.567 --> 00:10:22.467
a single origin.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:26.400
It happened in the deep ocean
darkness on September 15,

00:10:26.533 --> 00:10:29.567
about four billion years ago.

00:10:30.567 --> 00:10:34.900
Within this tiny single-celled
organism was a kind of chemical ladder,

00:10:36.033 --> 00:10:38.433
the DNA double helix.

00:10:40.467 --> 00:10:42.867
Star stuff...

00:10:43.233 --> 00:10:46.166
Oxygen, carbon, nitrogen...

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:49.333
Elements cooked in the
hearts of distant stars,

00:10:49.467 --> 00:10:52.834
combined with hydrogen from
the Big Bang to become alive

00:10:52.967 --> 00:10:55.233
on this little world.

00:10:55.533 --> 00:10:58.934
Through random changes,
mutations in the genes,

00:10:59.066 --> 00:11:01.700
some of which led to
more successful life-forms,

00:11:01.834 --> 00:11:04.333
what we call evolution
by natural selection.

00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:09.834
The ladder grew,
adding more and more rungs.

00:11:11.433 --> 00:11:14.967
It took another three billion
years for life to evolve the

00:11:15.100 --> 00:11:18.333
complexity of the plants and
animals that you could see

00:11:18.467 --> 00:11:20.633
with the naked eye.

00:11:26.834 --> 00:11:29.567
If the Cosmic
Calendar had holidays,

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:32.600
surely December 26
would be one of them.

00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:36.467
Some time on this day,
about 200 million years ago,

00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:40.166
the first mammals evolved.

00:11:40.533 --> 00:11:42.867
They brought a new
feature to life on Earth:

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.467
The neocortex.

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:48.166
Back in the Triassic,

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:51.834
the odds were against her kind,
but the dinosaurs that

00:11:51.967 --> 00:11:54.800
terrorized the
mammals went extinct.

00:11:55.934 --> 00:11:58.900
It was the evolution of
the neocortex in small,

00:11:59.033 --> 00:12:01.033
furtive creatures
such as this one,

00:12:01.567 --> 00:12:05.233
that enabled their descendants
to take over the planet.

00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.033
Mammals brought
something else that was new.

00:12:09.333 --> 00:12:11.066
They suckled their young.

00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.800
They nurtured them.

00:12:13.934 --> 00:12:16.233
And there was love.

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:20.867
Mother's Day on
the Cosmic Calendar.

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.600
Evolution by natural selection
means that those living things

00:12:27.734 --> 00:12:30.834
able to better adapt to their
environment are more likely to

00:12:30.967 --> 00:12:33.333
survive and leave offspring.

00:12:34.066 --> 00:12:37.700
Intelligence can be a
huge selective advantage.

00:12:38.066 --> 00:12:41.867
The fate of this planet was
changed forever by an event

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.500
involving just 13 atoms.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.133
How small is 13 atoms?

00:12:47.266 --> 00:12:50.934
It's a quadrillionth the
size of a grain of salt.

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:55.467
A mutation occurred in the DNA
of just one of our ancestors.

00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:59.967
Every source of self-esteem,
everything we've learned,

00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:03.734
and built, might come down
to nothing more than this.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.734
One base pair of
a single gene.

00:13:08.767 --> 00:13:13.000
Just a single rung programmed
the neocortex to grow larger

00:13:13.133 --> 00:13:15.133
still and fold more deeply.

00:13:15.934 --> 00:13:18.567
Maybe it was a random
zap from a cosmic ray,

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:22.200
or a simple error in transmission
from one cell to another.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.800
Whatever it was, it led to
a change in our species that

00:13:27.934 --> 00:13:30.467
would ultimately
affect every other species

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.133
of life on Earth.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:36.600
It happened late on
New Year's Eve on this.

00:13:36.734 --> 00:13:39.800
Cosmic Calendar of ours.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.066
To think that,
for good or evil,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.400
our ability to feel loyalty
and concern for increasingly

00:13:50.533 --> 00:13:54.033
larger groups, our obsession
with certain belief systems,

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:57.266
our capacity to
imagine the future,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:01.533
our power to transform the
world and to search the cosmos

00:14:01.667 --> 00:14:04.000
for answers...

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:07.233
The very name we gave
to our own species,

00:14:07.367 --> 00:14:11.567
homo sapiens, Latin for
"wise persons" all of it

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:16.200
comes down to nothing more
than a single rung on our tiny

00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:18.500
DNA ladder to the stars.

00:14:22.133 --> 00:14:24.800
For much of the last hour
on the Cosmic Calendar,

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:27.700
for all but the last minute,

00:14:27.834 --> 00:14:30.200
our ancestors were
hunters and gatherers,

00:14:31.700 --> 00:14:34.533
living in small bands.

00:14:40.867 --> 00:14:43.533
You know, when
people just shrug and say

00:14:43.667 --> 00:14:46.867
"chalk it up to human nature,"
it puzzles me.

00:14:47.967 --> 00:14:50.033
They're usually
talking about our greed,

00:14:50.166 --> 00:14:52.967
our arrogance, our violence.

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:54.776
But we've been human
for at least a couple of

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.700
hundred thousand years.

00:14:56.834 --> 00:14:59.934
For most of that time we
weren't that way at all.

00:15:00.800 --> 00:15:02.433
How do we know?

00:15:02.567 --> 00:15:05.133
From the accounts of
explorers and anthropologists

00:15:05.266 --> 00:15:07.934
encountering surviving
hunter-gatherer societies

00:15:08.066 --> 00:15:10.867
across four centuries.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.500
There are, of course,
exceptions, especially in

00:15:13.633 --> 00:15:16.233
the circumstances
of extreme scarcity.

00:15:16.367 --> 00:15:20.066
But the overwhelming consensus
paints a picture of humans

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:22.467
who lived in relative
harmony with each other

00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:24.500
and the environment.

00:15:24.633 --> 00:15:27.500
We shared the little we
had because we knew that our

00:15:27.633 --> 00:15:30.033
survival depended
on the group.

00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:34.066
We didn't prize wealth beyond
our needs because possessions

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:36.233
would just weigh us
down as we wandered.

00:15:37.233 --> 00:15:40.233
We were different from our
non-human primate ancestors

00:15:40.367 --> 00:15:43.500
with their alpha-males
bullying their way to dominance.

00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:55.300
And where was God?

00:15:57.233 --> 00:15:59.066
Everywhere.

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.934
In the rocks and in the rivers,

00:16:01.066 --> 00:16:05.133
in the trees, in the
birds and every living thing.

00:16:05.433 --> 00:16:07.400
And that was human nature
for a couple of

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:09.967
hundred thousand years.

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:13.567
I'm standing on the southern
tip of Africa and imagining

00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.967
what it was like some
time in the last hundreds

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:17.800
of thousands of years.

00:16:17.934 --> 00:16:22.166
Back then, Africa was home to
all the world's homo sapiens...

00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:25.767
All 10,000 of them.

00:16:26.233 --> 00:16:29.200
If you were an extra-terrestrial
on a survey mission,

00:16:29.333 --> 00:16:32.834
you might have thought we
were an endangered species.

00:16:32.967 --> 00:16:36.867
Someday soon there
will be ten billion of us.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.333
What happened?

00:16:38.467 --> 00:16:40.667
How did we become
the globe-girdling,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.767
space-traveling
species that we are today?

00:16:52.834 --> 00:16:56.300
Welcome to the first
laboratory on Earth.

00:16:56.433 --> 00:16:59.300
We're in Blombos Cave
where the evolution of the mind

00:16:59.433 --> 00:17:01.300
made a great leap.

00:17:01.433 --> 00:17:03.767
Our ancestors were conducting
chemistry experiments

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.867
here with a mineral
rich in iron, ocher.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:12.533
They used it to decorate
objects with bits of red color,

00:17:12.667 --> 00:17:15.100
but it may have
also had other uses,

00:17:15.233 --> 00:17:17.033
to preserve animal
hides or as a medicine,

00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.100
or as a way to
sharpen their tools,

00:17:21.867 --> 00:17:24.333
or maybe as an
insect repellent.

00:17:25.834 --> 00:17:28.100
And they engraved the
ocher with symbols.

00:17:28.233 --> 00:17:32.000
Something completely
new on the planet Earth, art.

00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:35.467
Not to be eaten.

00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.333
Not to provide shelter.

00:17:37.467 --> 00:17:40.066
But to symbolize something...

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:42.367
Or just to be.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.900
It looks a little
bit like a ladder,

00:17:45.033 --> 00:17:46.533
or a double helix.

00:17:46.667 --> 00:17:48.333
Whatever it was
supposed to be,

00:17:48.467 --> 00:17:51.600
it's the earliest remnant
we have of human culture.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.367
We had found a way to leave
behind something distinctly human.

00:17:56.734 --> 00:18:00.133
A means to communicate,
however enigmatically,

00:18:00.266 --> 00:18:04.600
to you and me
100,000 years away.

00:18:05.667 --> 00:18:08.633
A great power was discovered
here in Blombos Cave.

00:18:16.433 --> 00:18:19.800
At 25 cosmic
seconds-to-midnight,

00:18:19.934 --> 00:18:23.266
between 10,000
and 12,000 years ago,

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.834
humans discovered
another great power.

00:18:28.567 --> 00:18:31.000
Instead of foraging for food,

00:18:31.133 --> 00:18:33.734
we learned how to
grow it in the earth.

00:18:35.133 --> 00:18:38.400
This changed everything.

00:18:38.834 --> 00:18:40.767
Our ancestors did
something else they had

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:42.633
never done before.

00:18:42.767 --> 00:18:45.166
They invented new tools,
technology,

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:49.333
to plant and pull
food out of the earth.

00:18:50.033 --> 00:18:53.100
They settled down
and moved indoors.

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:56.600
Our relationship to
nature, and to one another,

00:18:56.734 --> 00:18:59.300
would never be the same.

00:18:59.767 --> 00:19:02.166
This agricultural revolution,

00:19:02.300 --> 00:19:05.133
the domestication of
plants and animals,

00:19:05.266 --> 00:19:08.433
is the mother of all
revolutions because all

00:19:08.567 --> 00:19:10.834
others trace back to it.

00:19:10.967 --> 00:19:13.367
Its consequences
reach far beyond even our

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.834
own moment in time.

00:19:15.967 --> 00:19:17.800
Like most revolutions,

00:19:17.934 --> 00:19:20.867
this one brought
change that was both great,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.600
and horrifying.

00:19:22.734 --> 00:19:26.533
There was a new concept
in the world, "Home."

00:19:27.734 --> 00:19:30.867
A specific place on the
planet where your ancestors,

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.300
and you, were born and lived.

00:19:34.767 --> 00:19:37.633
And over time these
settlements grew larger,

00:19:37.767 --> 00:19:43.367
until about 20 cosmic seconds
ago or around 7000 BCE.

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:52.100
Welcome to Çatalhöyük,

00:19:52.233 --> 00:19:54.734
a community on
the Anatolian plain.

00:19:54.867 --> 00:19:57.967
It's about 9,000 years ago
and everyone has settled

00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.200
in for the evening.

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:03.533
Tonight, roughly the same
number of people who once

00:20:03.667 --> 00:20:07.300
populated all of Africa
are living together

00:20:07.433 --> 00:20:09.667
in this proto-city.

00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.800
The city is such a new idea,

00:20:12.934 --> 00:20:15.266
they haven't
invented the street yet,

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.066
or the window.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.900
So the only way you can get
into your apartment is to walk

00:20:20.033 --> 00:20:22.934
along the rooftops till
you arrive at the opening

00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:24.567
to your dwelling.

00:20:26.033 --> 00:20:28.967
Çatalhöyük lacked something
much more significant than

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:32.233
streets and windows.

00:20:32.867 --> 00:20:36.066
There is no palace here.

00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.767
The bitter price that the
invention of agriculture cost

00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.967
human society had
yet to be paid.

00:20:42.266 --> 00:20:46.100
Here, there was no dominance
of the few over the many.

00:20:46.233 --> 00:20:49.600
There was no 1%
attaining lavish wealth,

00:20:49.734 --> 00:20:52.800
while most everyone
else merely subsisted.

00:20:52.934 --> 00:20:56.100
Forensic analysis of the
women, men, and children

00:20:56.233 --> 00:20:59.600
who lived here show a
remarkable similarity in diet.

00:21:00.967 --> 00:21:05.100
They still cherished the
hunter-gatherer ethos of sharing.

00:21:05.734 --> 00:21:08.900
Çatalhöyük was egalitarian.

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:12.166
The weakest ate the same
food that the strongest did,

00:21:13.133 --> 00:21:16.333
and everyone lived in
the same kind of home.

00:21:16.834 --> 00:21:19.333
But, man, it was
anything but drab.

00:21:19.467 --> 00:21:22.233
Come on. I'll show you.

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.300
This was a typical apartment
in one of the first cities,

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.567
Çatalhöyük,
in what is now Turkey,

00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.333
as it looked about
9,000 years ago.

00:21:48.533 --> 00:21:51.200
They were a lot like us.

00:21:52.734 --> 00:21:55.166
This bit of volcanic glass,

00:21:55.300 --> 00:21:57.800
called obsidian,
made an excellent mirror.

00:22:01.133 --> 00:22:04.533
If we could only find a
way to see all the things

00:22:04.667 --> 00:22:06.533
that were once reflected here.

00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:12.233
This apartment was home
for an extended family of

00:22:12.367 --> 00:22:14.400
seven to ten people.

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:16.500
Every apartment had a
similar floor plan.

00:22:17.700 --> 00:22:22.633
Bedroom. Living room.
Kitchen.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.000
Plaster auroch head.

00:22:28.133 --> 00:22:31.734
The people of Çatalhöyük
had a passion for decorating.

00:22:32.033 --> 00:22:34.834
Apartments were richly
appointed with the teeth and

00:22:34.967 --> 00:22:37.166
bones and skins of animals.

00:22:38.233 --> 00:22:40.900
The ocher that our
ancestors picked up in Africa,

00:22:41.033 --> 00:22:44.600
about 100,000 years before,
was now the medium of choice

00:22:45.667 --> 00:22:48.400
for the interior
decorators of Çatalhöyük.

00:22:53.266 --> 00:22:56.166
And the red ocher had yet
another profound application.

00:22:57.233 --> 00:23:00.800
They used it to create
an entirely new art form:

00:23:01.133 --> 00:23:02.667
The map.

00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.100
For the first time ever,
humans created a

00:23:05.233 --> 00:23:08.300
two-dimensional representation
of their location

00:23:08.433 --> 00:23:10.867
in space and time.

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:16.567
"This is where my home is
in relation to the volcano."

00:23:17.633 --> 00:23:19.600
And with a few
magical strokes,

00:23:19.734 --> 00:23:22.867
the artist sent a message
across 9,000 years...

00:23:23.767 --> 00:23:27.533
"I was here when the
volcano awakened."

00:23:36.433 --> 00:23:39.433
The experiment at
Çatalhöyük was a success,

00:23:39.567 --> 00:23:43.000
and within a few thousand years
there were cities everywhere.

00:24:00.567 --> 00:24:02.734
When different
kinds of people congregate

00:24:02.867 --> 00:24:04.066
in a single place,

00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.000
ideas are exchanged
and new possibilities arise.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.400
The city is a kind of brain,

00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:12.967
creating and
processing new ideas.

00:24:16.133 --> 00:24:18.200
Here, in the
city of Amsterdam,

00:24:18.333 --> 00:24:20.767
in the 17th century,
citizens of the old and

00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:23.567
new worlds mingled as
they never had before,

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:26.934
and there was an unprecedented
freedom of thought.

00:24:27.867 --> 00:24:31.767
These conditions produced a
golden age of science and art.

00:24:32.467 --> 00:24:35.567
In Italy, Giordano Bruno
had proclaimed the existence

00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:37.166
of other worlds.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:40.834
For this he had
been made to suffer.

00:24:41.867 --> 00:24:44.233
But a mere 50 years
later in Holland,

00:24:44.367 --> 00:24:46.166
the astronomer
Christiaan Huygens,

00:24:46.300 --> 00:24:49.533
who held the same belief,
was showered with honors.

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:56.133
Light was the
central theme of the age:

00:24:56.533 --> 00:25:00.500
The enlightenment
of human curiosity set free,

00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:03.266
and the light shed
by Europe's first look at

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.133
the once hidden realms
of the planet.

00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:10.066
The light that permeated
the paintings of the time,

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.900
particularly the
work of Vermeer.

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:17.500
And light as an object
of scientific inquiry.

00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.867
For generations, textile
merchants had used a lens to

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.400
examine the thread count
of finely stitched fabrics.

00:25:25.533 --> 00:25:27.367
In the Amsterdam of that time,

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.467
there lived three
men whose passion for

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.967
light inspired them to use that
ancient device in a completely new way.

00:25:35.367 --> 00:25:38.467
They aimed the textile
merchants' lens at objects no

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.734
one had ever thought to
examine closely before.

00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:45.266
It became a window, an
aperture for finding and

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:47.867
exploring new worlds.

00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:51.633
Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek
used a single lens to reveal

00:25:51.767 --> 00:25:54.533
the teeming microcosm
in a drop of water.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.700
His friend,

00:26:03.834 --> 00:26:06.333
Christiaan Huygens used
two lenses to bring the stars,

00:26:06.467 --> 00:26:09.133
planets, and
moons close enough to

00:26:09.266 --> 00:26:11.233
reveal their features.

00:26:11.967 --> 00:26:15.133
Huygens became the first to
see that Saturn's rings did not

00:26:15.266 --> 00:26:19.500
touch the planet, and the first to
understand what they really were.

00:26:21.166 --> 00:26:24.066
He also discovered
Saturn's largest moon, Titan.

00:26:25.567 --> 00:26:27.133
Huygens, like Bruno,

00:26:27.266 --> 00:26:29.867
believed that the
stars were other suns,

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:33.266
orbited by their own
systems of planets and moons.

00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:36.200
But why was there no hint
of those other worlds and

00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:40.433
their living things in
the sacred books?

00:26:41.934 --> 00:26:44.633
Whatever disquiet this
contradiction may have stirred

00:26:44.767 --> 00:26:48.000
in the hearts and minds of the
leaders of the Enlightenment,

00:26:48.133 --> 00:26:51.667
there was only one man who
dared to address it head-on.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.767
He was another
wizard of light.

00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.333
Baruch Spinoza had been
a member of the Jewish

00:26:57.467 --> 00:27:00.000
congregation of Amsterdam
through his teenage years.

00:27:01.166 --> 00:27:03.867
But in his early 20s, he
began to speak publicly of

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.300
a new vision of God.

00:27:07.667 --> 00:27:10.633
Spinoza's God was the
physical laws of the universe.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.633
His sacred text,
the book of nature.

00:27:18.367 --> 00:27:20.567
The Jews of Amsterdam
were mostly refugees from

00:27:20.700 --> 00:27:23.633
the vicious Inquisitions
in Spain and Portugal,

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.900
where so many of them had
been tortured and murdered.

00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.900
Amsterdam had
offered the Jews a refuge,

00:27:32.033 --> 00:27:34.400
and they must have seen
Spinoza's radical ideas as a

00:27:34.533 --> 00:27:37.567
threat to their
hard-won security in Holland.

00:27:38.233 --> 00:27:40.133
They excommunicated
the young rebel,

00:27:40.266 --> 00:27:42.867
and decreed that he
must be forever shunned.

00:27:43.533 --> 00:27:46.734
Spinoza accepted their
punishment with dignity,

00:27:46.867 --> 00:27:49.400
but without a
trace of submission.

00:27:49.533 --> 00:27:51.500
He moved nearby, to The Hague.

00:27:51.633 --> 00:27:54.900
Where he went even further,
daring to write that the Bible

00:27:55.033 --> 00:27:58.834
was not dictated by God,
but written by human beings.

00:27:59.333 --> 00:28:00.767
Spinoza wrote:

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:03.100
"Do not look for
God in miracles."

00:28:03.233 --> 00:28:06.100
Miracles are violations
of the laws of nature.

00:28:06.633 --> 00:28:09.633
"God is best apprehended in
the study of those laws."

00:28:11.467 --> 00:28:14.233
No one had ever said
these things aloud before.

00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:18.200
Spinoza knew that he was
testing the limits of free thought,

00:28:18.333 --> 00:28:20.367
even for Holland.

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:26.867
To him, an official
state religion was more than

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:30.166
spiritual coercion
of the individual.

00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:33.500
Spinoza regarded the
miraculous events of the major

00:28:33.633 --> 00:28:36.900
religious traditions as
organized superstition.

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.967
In his view, magical
thinking posed a danger to

00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:45.867
the future citizens of a
rational, free society.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.600
There could be no such
thing as democracy without the

00:28:49.734 --> 00:28:52.433
separation of
church and state.

00:28:52.567 --> 00:28:55.300
He wrote a book that
introduced the ideas at the

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:58.800
heart of the American and
many another revolution.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.734
Then, as now, there were
those who were threatened

00:29:03.867 --> 00:29:05.834
by this view of God.

00:29:16.967 --> 00:29:19.500
Spinoza continued to
write and speak about his

00:29:19.633 --> 00:29:22.133
revolutionary view of God,

00:29:22.266 --> 00:29:25.100
always wearing the slashed
cape as a badge of honor.

00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:31.266
He died at 44, possibly from
inhaling particles of dust

00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.333
during his years of
grinding lenses for

00:29:33.467 --> 00:29:35.633
microscopes and telescopes.

00:29:36.934 --> 00:29:40.800
250 years later, another man
with a passion for light made

00:29:40.934 --> 00:29:43.400
a pilgrimage to the
humble workroom that had been

00:29:43.533 --> 00:29:46.133
preserved as a testament
to the vast influence of.

00:29:46.266 --> 00:29:48.300
Spinoza's philosophy.

00:29:48.433 --> 00:29:52.166
This man, world famous for
finding a new law of nature,

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.500
was often asked if
he believed in God.

00:29:55.633 --> 00:29:57.633
Albert Einstein replied:

00:29:58.233 --> 00:30:04.300
"I believe in Spinoza's God, who reveals
himself in the harmony of all that exists."

00:30:08.233 --> 00:30:11.500
Our understanding of nature's
laws has advanced far beyond.

00:30:11.633 --> 00:30:14.667
Spinoza's, and even
Einstein's wildest dreams.

00:30:15.967 --> 00:30:19.600
But there is one law of nature
we cannot seem to grasp.

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.033
Inscribed in the book of
nature is a parable about an

00:30:23.166 --> 00:30:25.800
ancient alliance
between two kingdoms.

00:30:26.533 --> 00:30:29.667
And those who
would tear it apart.

00:30:42.333 --> 00:30:44.967
Long ago,
there were two kingdoms.

00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.400
An alliance was
formed between them,

00:30:47.533 --> 00:30:50.533
one that would bring them
both riches beyond measure.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.400
A partnership lasting more
than a 100 million years.

00:30:55.533 --> 00:30:59.700
And then a new kind of being
evolved in one of the two kingdoms.

00:31:00.233 --> 00:31:04.834
Its descendants plundered the
riches and violated the alliance.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.567
In their arrogance, they
became a mortal danger to both

00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:11.500
kingdoms and to themselves.

00:31:23.166 --> 00:31:25.433
This parable is true.

00:31:25.567 --> 00:31:29.266
It's the story of two of the half
dozen realms of life on Earth,

00:31:29.400 --> 00:31:32.467
the plant and animal kingdoms.

00:31:33.166 --> 00:31:35.967
It's not easy being green.

00:31:37.133 --> 00:31:40.600
Sex is challenging when
you're stuck in one place.

00:31:40.734 --> 00:31:42.000
There's no dating.

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:45.033
You just sit there and
cast your seed to the winds.

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.633
Literally.

00:31:47.767 --> 00:31:50.200
You just wait for
the wind to blow.

00:31:50.333 --> 00:31:52.467
If you get lucky,
some of your pollen will

00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:55.500
be carried away and land on
the sexual reproductive part

00:31:55.633 --> 00:31:58.066
of another plant.

00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:00.600
The plants played this
hit-or-miss game of chance for

00:32:00.734 --> 00:32:02.967
a couple of
hundred million years,

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:06.834
until insects
evolved to play cupid.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.800
What resulted was one of the
great co-evolution marriages

00:32:13.934 --> 00:32:15.800
in the history of life.

00:32:15.934 --> 00:32:18.333
The insect would visit a
flower for a dinner of

00:32:18.467 --> 00:32:20.667
protein-rich pollen.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:23.633
Inevitably, some of the
pollen would stick to the body

00:32:23.767 --> 00:32:25.467
of the insect.

00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.500
The insect would
visit another flower,

00:32:27.633 --> 00:32:30.367
bringing along the
leftovers on its body.

00:32:30.934 --> 00:32:33.967
That pollen
fertilized the next flower,

00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:36.333
allowing it to reproduce.

00:32:37.233 --> 00:32:40.467
It was a win-win deal for both
the flowers and the insects,

00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:44.000
causing a series of delightful
evolutionary developments.

00:32:45.233 --> 00:32:48.100
A new plant arose that
produced sugary nectar in

00:32:48.233 --> 00:32:50.033
addition to the pollen.

00:32:50.166 --> 00:32:54.000
Now, the insects came not
just for their basic meal of pollen,

00:32:54.667 --> 00:32:57.066
but also for dessert.

00:32:57.667 --> 00:33:01.166
The insects got chubbier,
evolved furry bodies and even

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:04.400
little pouches on their legs
to snag more pollen on their

00:33:04.533 --> 00:33:06.767
daily rounds in the flowers.

00:33:09.066 --> 00:33:11.300
Now there were bees.

00:33:12.433 --> 00:33:14.533
This was a bonus for
yet another species of

00:33:14.667 --> 00:33:16.367
the animal kingdom...

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:18.300
Us.

00:33:21.734 --> 00:33:24.567
We are indebted to the bees
and their fellow pollinators

00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.000
for something even more
vital to our survival.

00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:31.700
Every third bite of food you
take-and this is even true for

00:33:31.834 --> 00:33:35.633
those of us who are omnivores,
was made possible by them.

00:33:36.467 --> 00:33:40.000
35% of the world's crops
depend on their cooperation.

00:33:40.867 --> 00:33:43.100
The plants eat starlight...

00:33:43.233 --> 00:33:46.567
And we, and the animals,
we eat plants.

00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.734
And they don't just increase
the quantity of available food.

00:33:50.867 --> 00:33:53.767
We owe them for much of the
biodiversity that has made our

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:57.200
food supply so dependable.

00:33:57.333 --> 00:33:59.700
But we're
working them to death.

00:33:59.834 --> 00:34:01.400
And for the first time ever,

00:34:01.533 --> 00:34:06.066
many kinds of bees are on
the endangered species list.

00:34:18.066 --> 00:34:21.000
I think you know
where this is headed.

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.900
The blessing and the curse
of the invention of agriculture

00:34:34.033 --> 00:34:36.467
has brought us here, to
the Halls of Extinction.

00:34:47.133 --> 00:34:51.333
A memorial to all the
living things lost in the mass

00:34:51.467 --> 00:34:54.033
extinction events
in Earth's history.

00:34:54.934 --> 00:34:59.600
It's a monument to the broken
branches on the tree of life.

00:35:00.633 --> 00:35:03.500
Five times in the
history of life,

00:35:03.633 --> 00:35:07.133
cataclysmic geological,
and astronomical events,

00:35:07.266 --> 00:35:11.867
have threatened to
extinguish life itself.

00:35:13.533 --> 00:35:16.867
The sixth one is different.

00:35:17.133 --> 00:35:20.266
The last time we were
here together this hallway

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.000
had no name.

00:35:22.133 --> 00:35:23.333
Why?

00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:26.000
Because back then a
scientific consensus had yet

00:35:26.133 --> 00:35:30.533
to be reached that we were in the
midst of a mass extinction event.

00:35:31.266 --> 00:35:32.800
That's changed.

00:35:32.934 --> 00:35:36.100
Now, this hallway has a name.

00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.867
It's ours.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.066
The Anthropocene.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:48.633
"Anthropo" from the Greek
word for "human" and "Cene."

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:52.900
the Greek word for "recent."

00:36:10.333 --> 00:36:13.100
These are the species
we hunted to extinction back

00:36:13.233 --> 00:36:15.633
when we were wanderers.

00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:19.367
Including our own
cousins, the Neanderthals.

00:36:34.867 --> 00:36:37.200
What is it about
us, as a species,

00:36:37.333 --> 00:36:41.133
that wherever we go,
we bring death?

00:36:45.233 --> 00:36:48.333
Beyond here lies the future.

00:36:48.467 --> 00:36:52.367
Even now it's not too late to
keep this corridor from lengthening.

00:36:54.467 --> 00:36:57.266
If we fail...

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.233
But if we succeed...

00:37:11.567 --> 00:37:13.333
Come with me.

00:37:26.834 --> 00:37:30.400
In a possible
future only decades away,

00:37:30.533 --> 00:37:34.934
project Starshot, a
flotilla of 1,000 spacecraft,

00:37:35.066 --> 00:37:37.233
will depart from Earth.

00:37:37.367 --> 00:37:40.467
This part of the Atacama Desert
west of the Andes Mountains,

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.934
is so dry that it hasn't
rained in recorded history.

00:37:45.367 --> 00:37:48.400
And that's great for us
because we're going to need

00:37:48.533 --> 00:37:50.367
the clearest of skies.

00:38:22.567 --> 00:38:25.066
There were no witnesses
when the first life left the

00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:28.100
water for the land.

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.967
There was nobody to file a
report when the first birds

00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:33.367
took to the skies.

00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.033
But this is one great leap
that will be documented in

00:38:36.166 --> 00:38:38.600
every conceivable way.

00:38:38.734 --> 00:38:41.266
The whole world is watching.

00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:45.166
We are, after all, sending
our first craft directly to the

00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:48.900
planets of another sun:
The Alpha Centauri system.

00:38:52.300 --> 00:38:55.667
These are the ships that
will carry our senses there.

00:38:55.800 --> 00:38:59.500
These are interstellar sailing
ships propelled by light.

00:39:00.133 --> 00:39:03.700
Their hulls weigh but a gram,
and they are no larger than a

00:39:03.834 --> 00:39:07.367
pea, and yet they're equipped
with all that NASA's Voyagers

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:09.633
have and more.

00:39:19.166 --> 00:39:22.166
When the first light blasts
forth from this phased array

00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:26.533
of lasers, the spacecraft will
accelerate from zero to 20% of

00:39:26.667 --> 00:39:30.200
the speed of light
in mere minutes.

00:39:30.467 --> 00:39:33.400
Inside each nanocraft is
everything needed to perform

00:39:33.533 --> 00:39:37.400
the preliminary reconnaissance
of the worlds of another star

00:39:37.533 --> 00:39:40.567
and return that visual
and scientific information

00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:42.800
back to Earth.

00:39:44.166 --> 00:39:46.533
Space is mostly empty,

00:39:46.667 --> 00:39:48.600
but there are tiny dust
particles that could

00:39:48.734 --> 00:39:51.467
wreak havoc if they
were to collide with nanocraft

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.467
traveling at such high speeds.

00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.233
That's one of the reasons we
need to send so many of them.

00:40:13.967 --> 00:40:17.600
Voyager 1 is traveling
at 38,000 miles per hour.

00:40:18.667 --> 00:40:21.767
It left home more
than 40 years ago.

00:40:23.066 --> 00:40:25.700
It will take these
nanocraft only four days

00:40:25.834 --> 00:40:27.400
to overtake her.

00:40:27.533 --> 00:40:29.033
That's pretty fast,

00:40:29.166 --> 00:40:32.066
but still only 20%
of the speed of light.

00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.300
Proxima Centauri is
four light-years away.

00:40:35.433 --> 00:40:37.600
That's a 20 year one-way trip.

00:40:40.567 --> 00:40:43.100
Orbiting Proxima Centauri,
there is a world in the

00:40:43.233 --> 00:40:46.934
habitable zone where we
think life might flourish.

00:40:49.934 --> 00:40:52.333
Our robotic emissaries
will send accounts from

00:40:52.467 --> 00:40:55.166
these new worlds.

00:40:55.467 --> 00:40:58.033
Their messages will race
back to us on radio waves

00:40:58.166 --> 00:40:59.967
at the speed of light.

00:41:00.100 --> 00:41:03.667
They'll take four years to
reach us: 20 years one-way,

00:41:04.367 --> 00:41:06.233
four years back.

00:41:06.367 --> 00:41:09.367
That's a 24-year round-trip.

00:41:09.734 --> 00:41:14.266
Many of you will be there then
to read and to write those new

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.700
pages in the book of nature,

00:41:16.834 --> 00:41:19.767
and to chart our future
course of wandering...

00:41:43.433 --> 00:41:45.834
No longer
bounded by the earth,

00:41:45.967 --> 00:41:48.567
the ocean,

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.433
or the sky.
